Select your distribution:
  1) Kali Linux
  2) Ubuntu
  3) Debian
  4) Configure only (no distro-specific changes)
  0) Exit
\`\`\`

**Option 1-3:** Installs distro-specific packages and configurations
**Option 4:** Only configures users and RDP without installing distro packages (useful for re-runs)
**Option 0:** Exit without changes

### Configuration Prompts

After selecting your distribution, you'll be prompted for:

1. **Username** - User account to create (default: "user")
2. **Password** - Secure password for the user (minimum 8 characters recommended)
3. **Enable Linux RDP Server** - Set up this machine as an RDP server (y/n)
4. **Password Login Only** - Security option for RDP authentication (y/n)
5. **Windows RDP Target** - Optional: IP address of Windows machine to connect to
6. **Windows Credentials** - Optional: Username and password for Windows RDP

## Connecting via RDP

### From Windows to Linux

1. **Open Remote Desktop Connection** (mstsc.exe)
2. **Enter the connection details:**
   \`\`\`
   Computer: YOUR_LINUX_IP:3389
   Username: your_username
   \`\`\`
3. **Click Connect** and enter your password

### From Linux to Windows

**Command Line (xfreerdp):**
\`\`\`bash
xfreerdp /u:USERNAME /p:'PASSWORD' /v:WINDOWS_IP
\`\`\`

**GUI (Remmina):**
1. Launch Remmina
2. Click "New Connection"
3. Select "RDP" protocol
4. Enter Windows IP and credentials
5. Click Connect

### From Linux to Linux

\`\`\`bash
xfreerdp /u:USERNAME /v:LINUX_IP:3389
\`\`\`

## Security Considerations

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT SECURITY WARNINGS:**

1. **Firewall Configuration**
   - The installer opens port 3389 for RDP
   - Do NOT expose this port directly to the internet
   - Use a VPN or SSH tunnel for remote access

2. **Strong Passwords**
   - Always use passwords with 8+ characters
   - Include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
   - Consider using a password manager

3. **Network Security**
   - RDP should only be used on trusted networks
   - For internet access, use SSH tunneling:
     \`\`\`bash
     ssh -L 3389:localhost:3389 user@remote-server
     # Then connect to localhost:3389
     \`\`\`

4. **Regular Updates**
   - Keep your system updated: `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade`
   - Monitor security advisories for xrdp

5. **User Permissions**
   - The created user is added to the sudo group
   - Review and restrict permissions as needed

## Troubleshooting

### RDP Connection Refused

**Check if xrdp is running:**
\`\`\`bash
sudo systemctl status xrdp
\`\`\`

**Restart xrdp:**
\`\`\`bash
sudo systemctl restart xrdp
\`\`\`

**Check firewall:**
\`\`\`bash
sudo ufw status
sudo ufw allow 3389/tcp
\`\`\`

### Black Screen After Login

This is often caused by display manager conflicts.

**Solution 1 - Check .xsession file:**
\`\`\`bash
cat ~/.xsession
# Should contain: exec startxfce4
\`\`\`

**Solution 2 - Recreate session file:**
\`\`\`bash
echo "exec startxfce4" > ~/.xsession
chmod +x ~/.xsession
\`\`\`

**Solution 3 - Check xrdp logs:**
\`\`\`bash
sudo tail -f /var/log/xrdp.log
sudo tail -f /var/log/xrdp-sesman.log
\`\`\`

### Connection Slow or Laggy

**Reduce color depth:**
Edit `/etc/xrdp/xrdp.ini`:
\`\`\`ini
max_bpp=16  # Change from 24 or 32
\`\`\`

**Disable desktop effects:**
In XFCE: Settings ‚Üí Window Manager Tweaks ‚Üí Compositor ‚Üí Disable

### Port Already in Use

**Check what's using port 3389:**
\`\`\`bash
sudo netstat -tulpn | grep 3389
\`\`\`

**Kill conflicting process:**
\`\`\`bash
sudo systemctl stop vncserver  # If VNC is running
sudo systemctl disable vncserver
\`\`\`

### Ubuntu Color Management Error

If you see authentication errors on Ubuntu, the installer should have fixed this, but you can manually verify:

\`\`\`bash
cat /etc/polkit-1/localauthority/50-local.d/45-allow-colord.pkla
\`\`\`

### Kali Linux Specific Issues

**Desktop not starting:**
\`\`\`bash
sudo apt install --reinstall kali-desktop-xfce
sudo systemctl restart xrdp
\`\`\`

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom RDP Port

Edit `/etc/xrdp/xrdp.ini`:
\`\`\`ini
port=3390  # Change from 3389
\`\`\`

Then update firewall:
\`\`\`bash
sudo ufw allow 3390/tcp
sudo systemctl restart xrdp
\`\`\`

### Multiple Concurrent Sessions

xrdp supports multiple users connecting simultaneously. Each user gets their own session.

### SSH Tunnel for Secure RDP

**On your local machine:**
\`\`\`bash
ssh -L 3389:localhost:3389 user@remote-linux-server
\`\`\`

**Then connect to:**
\`\`\`
localhost:3389
\`\`\`
